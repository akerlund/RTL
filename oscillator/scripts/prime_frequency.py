## Description: The Triangle generating module use a prime frequency as its
##   base. All possible triangle waves have frequencies that are lower than the
##   prime frequency as they are made from it using a clock enable module.
##   The possible frequencies are thus; f'/n, for n = 1, 2, 3, ... n - 1.
##   This script print out all possible frequencies the triangle waves can have.
